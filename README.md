# face_glitch
worked in python 2.7 on mac

A auto glitch and post python script using open CV. The tumblr/instagram APIs have changed.. 

This is a colletion of scrips that-
-searches for # on insta
-gliches out faces using Open Cv
-creates a .gif animaion
-posts to tumblr

The project used too many dependencies/ APIs that are buggy and are now deprecated.
